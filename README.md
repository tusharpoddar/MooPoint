# MooPoint
An android application that works for the welfare of stray animals in Delhi NCR. The application helps the user to make a service request when he/she see a animal in dire need. The mobile application allows the user to select this type of request and then send in an email to me at the end. 
All the data is being stored using Shared Preferences and intent is being used to access all of it at the time of sendnig the email. As soon as I get the email, several Delhi based NGOs acted upon that request.
